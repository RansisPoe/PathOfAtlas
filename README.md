# Path of Atlas

This is a Path of Building like tool for exploring the new Atlas passives. It currently runs as a webapp at https://pathofatlas.com, but there are plans to make a standalone installable version for Windows as well.

## Features and Roadmap

- [x] basic skill tree UI
- [x] zooming/panning
  - [ ] mobile support
- [x] sidebar with sum of stats
- [x] build sharing
- [x] undo/redo
- [x] allocate/unallocate multiple connected nodes with a single click
- [x] highlight shortest path to nodes on mouseover

## Local Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
